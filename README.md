# About this project

During August 2021, [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com) hosted an event called **30 days of ML**. The link to this event can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/30-days-of-ml). During the first half of August we, the participants, took various lessons covering introductory and intermediate level concepts of ML such as:

- Data preprocessing
- Model building
- Numerical and categorical features
- Dealing with missing values
- Cross-validation
- Ensemble models (Random Forest and XGBoost)
- Pipeline building
- Data leakage
- Overfitting and underfitting

During the second half, we were tasked with the challenge of building a pipeline to predict a target using the features in [this data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/30-days-of-ml/data). The contents of this repository are the notebooks I used for the deliverance of my submissions. I will be updating here my current and final standing on the leaderboard as well as my current and final model score (Root Mean Squared Error).
